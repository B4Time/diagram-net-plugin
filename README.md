# diagram-net-plugin
Drawio/Diagram.net Javascript Plug-in that allows the creation of B4Time models. B4Time models will be processed by the B4Time-Sim application (coming soon).

## Draw.io / Diagram.net Plugin to Draw B4Time models
This plugin works with the desktop version of draw.io/diagram.net. It hasn't been tried on the web version and as the export uses electron specific dialog, fs and other calls it will need some rework to work on the web.

## Install Draw.io/Diagram.net desktop application
Installation releases and instructions can be found here.
[Drawio-desktop-releases](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases)

## Get the Plugin
To get plugin (move it to your computer) you have two choices:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Save just the src/b4time.js file to somewhere on your machine.

## Install the Plugin
With draw.io/diagram.net install open it.
